# favorite_open_source_projects
A list of my favorite open-source projects so I don't forget they exist.

* [Presto](https://prestodb.io/): Facebook's distributed SQL Query Engine for Big Data. Similar to Google's [Dremel](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub36632) (which is not open-source as far as I know).
* [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/): Once you use them, you can't go back. Much better than Facebook's [Thrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift)  (which sucks).
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/): Google's RPC framework. Much better than Facebook's [Thrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift)  (which sucks).
* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/): Google's build system. Infinitely superior to `make` and similar crap. Also better than Facebook's [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/), which is a blatant copy of Bazel, but worse.
